# How to complete the task

1. Clone this repo locally
2. Run `yarn` to install all dependencies
3. Run `yarn dev` to test that everything runs OK
4. Open `/src/lib/Calendar.svelte` and start working

   - You can create as many componens as you need

   - You can only use included libraries: Tailwind, Luxon and Melt UI

5. Once finished, zip the src folder and upload it to Notion

_Hint: Write clear code that works!_
